### Administrative Safeguards (§164.308)
- Security Management Process: Risk analysis, risk management, sanction policy, information system activity review
- Assigned Security Responsibility: Designated security official
- Workforce Security: Authorization and supervision, workforce clearance, termination procedures
- Information Access Management: Access authorization, access establishment and modification
- Security Awareness Training: Security reminders, protection from malicious software, log-in monitoring, password management
- Security Incident Procedures: Response and reporting
- Contingency Plan: Data backup, disaster recovery, emergency mode operation, testing and revision
- Evaluation: Periodic technical and non-technical evaluation
- Business Associate Contracts: Written contracts with BAA provisions

### Physical Safeguards (§164.310)
- Facility Access Controls: Contingency operations, facility security plan, access control and validation, maintenance records
- Workstation Use: Policies for workstation use
- Workstation Security: Physical safeguards for workstations
- Device and Media Controls: Disposal, media re-use, accountability, data backup and storage

### Technical Safeguards (§164.312)
- Access Control: Unique user identification, emergency access procedure, automatic logoff, encryption and decryption
- Audit Controls: Hardware, software, and procedural mechanisms to record and examine access
- Integrity: Mechanisms to authenticate ePHI, protect from improper alteration or destruction
- Person or Entity Authentication: Procedures to verify identity
- Transmission Security: Integrity controls, encryption for data in transit

## PHI Categories

### Direct Identifiers (Must be protected or removed)
- Names
- Geographic data smaller than state
- Dates (except year) related to individual
- Phone numbers, fax numbers
- Email addresses
- Social Security numbers
- Medical record numbers
- Health plan beneficiary numbers
- Account numbers
- Certificate/license numbers
- Vehicle identifiers
- Device identifiers and serial numbers
- Web URLs
- IP addresses
- Biometric identifiers
- Full-face photographs
- Any other unique identifying number

### Clinical Data (PHI when combined with identifiers)
- Diagnosis codes (ICD-10)
- Procedure codes (CPT, HCPCS)
- Medication lists
- Lab results
- Clinical notes
- Treatment plans
- Imaging reports

## BAA Requirements

### What Requires a BAA
- Cloud service providers handling PHI
- AI/LLM providers if PHI is transmitted
- Analytics platforms processing PHI
- Communication platforms for patient messaging

### Key BAA Provisions
- Permitted uses and disclosures
- Safeguards implementation
- Reporting of security incidents
- Subcontractor requirements
- Return or destruction of PHI
- Compliance with Security Rule

## De-identification Standards

### Safe Harbor Method (§164.514(b)(2))
Remove all 18 identifiers and have no actual knowledge that remaining information can identify an individual.

### Expert Determination (§164.514(b)(1))
Statistical or scientific expert determines risk of re-identification is very small.

## Use Case Specific Compliance Notes

### Clinical Documentation
- Minimum necessary: Only access clinical data needed for the task
- Audit logging: Record all access to clinical notes
- De-identification consideration: Consider processing de-identified data when possible
- Consent: May require patient consent for AI-assisted documentation

### Prior Authorization
- Transaction standards: Must comply with X12 278 format requirements
- Minimum necessary: Only transmit required clinical data
- Timely response: CMS regulations on response times
- Audit trail: Complete record of authorization decisions

### Medical Coding
- Accuracy requirements: Codes must be supported by documentation
- Audit trail: Full history of code suggestions and selections
- Compliance: Avoid upcoding or unbundling issues
- Training data: Ensure coding AI trained on compliant data

### Patient Communication
- Consent for electronic communication
- Secure transmission (TLS 1.2+)
- Identity verification before sharing PHI
- Right to opt-out
- Retention policies for messages
